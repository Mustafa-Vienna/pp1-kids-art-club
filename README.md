# Kids Art Club

---

This project, called Kids Art Club, is about creating a website for a talented artist and fashion design student who teaches art to Uyghur children in Istanbul. She is amazing at what she does and needs more support to share her work and promote her art classes.

The website showcases her, and her students artworks and the Kids Art Club courses. It helps display her students's art, provides information about the courses, and makes it easy for people to sign up. She also need help with social media to reach more people and share her work.

This website was build as part of a full-stack software development program at Code Institute. The task was to create a statick front-end website using only HTML5 and CSS3 to present useful information to users.
