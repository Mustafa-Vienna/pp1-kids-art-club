# Kids Art Club

---

This project, called Kids Art Club, is about creating a website for a talented artist and fashion design student who teaches art to Uyghur children in Istanbul. She is amazing at what she does and needs more support to share her work and promote her art classes.

The website showcases her, and her students artworks and the Kids Art Club courses. It helps display her students's art, provides information about the courses, and makes it easy for people to sign up. She also need help with social media to reach more people and share her work.

This website was build as part of a full-stack software development program at Code Institute. The task was to create a statick front-end website using only HTML5 and CSS3 to present useful information to users.

  - **White Smoke (#f5f5f5e7)**: Used for placeholders and page background to keep the design clean.

- **Neutral Colors**:
  - **Blue Violet (rgba(113, 114, 117, 0.826))**: Used for borders to provide subtle separation between different section.
  - **Ghost White (#e0e1e9)**: Used for buttons to ensure they are easily identifiable and inviting to click.
  - **Light Cyan (#ddfdfe)**: Used for singup form background and hover effet to provide a gentle and interactive user experience.

### Content

The inspiration for this website came from the artist Zulayha, who I encountered during my recent vacation in Istanbul. Impressed by her artwork, ambition, and dedication to teaching children through art, I decided to assist her in creating her first ever website. THis project aims to showcase her creative journey and provide platform to share her passion for art with a wider audience. The content reflects her and her students unique artistic vision, incorprating elements of her style while ensuring an engaging and user-friendly experience.

### Media

All the pictures on the Kids Art Club website were provided by the teacher and artist, Zulayha. These images showcase the creativity and artistic expression fostered in her class.

### Acknowledgememts

A big thank you to my classmate/friend Ioan, a senior developer. He game me detailed advice, helped me manage my time, and tested my project.
